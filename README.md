## Tech Stack
* Front-End: React
* Back-End: Firebase
* Framework: Semantic UI


## Approach
Utilized a vinyl model in which users are able to create, edit, and delete listings of vinyl records they currently have in their collection.

## MVP
* A working full-stack application, using React front end, Firebase back end, and Semantic UI framework
* Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities with I
* At least three react components, defined in their own files, besides App.js.
* Be deployed online and accessible to the public
* A README.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, unsolved problems, user stories, and notes to yourself so you can come back to your project later in the course and be able to pick up your train of thought, etc

## Stretch Goals Attained
* React Router (Home Page, Listings, Contact Page)
* Animated components (hero carousel, button hovers, link hovers, key frames, etc.)
* Add contact page


## Future Features
* User Authentication 
* Mobile-First Approach
* Fully responsive across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)
